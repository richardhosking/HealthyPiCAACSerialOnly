A process for setting up to program the HealthyPi4 board to develop and modify code 
This was not simple - a fair number of steps need to be followed 

OS Linux Mint 20 ulyana

1. Download and Install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - I am using 1.8.19
2. Open the IDE -> Open File-> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager-> 
Add the url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json in the additional URL box 
Note that paste may not work - use Ctrl-V
3.  Obtain the HealthyPi Arduino code from Github here or 
Download the latest Arduino Library for HealthyPi v4 from the Protocentral site at 
https://healthypi.protocentral.com/
4. Open one of the example sketches -> Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage library -> Add zip library -> browse to where you have saved the Protocentral zip library -> Install
5. Open a sketch File -> Examples -> Protocentral HealthyPi v4 library -> Default BLE and Pi mode
6. Tools ->  board -> Boards Manager -> filter search to ESP32
7. "by Espressif Sytems" - note that the latest libraries will not work 
select version 1.0.6 and install
8. Select the relevant board Tools -> board -> ESP32 Arduino -> ESP32 Dev board
9. Select the partition scheme Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB APP with OTA/190KB SPIFFS)
Other options should be default 
10. Select the relevant port after connecting via USB to the board 

11. Upload your sketch - if all is well you should get something like..
(If not fix the errors and start again :) )

Sketch uses 1511926 bytes (76%) of program storage space. Maximum is 1966080 bytes.
Global variables use 95728 bytes (29%) of dynamic memory, leaving 231952 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 327680 bytes.

To run the Java Processing IDE 
Open a terminal
Navigate to where Processing is located - in the this case /Desktop/processing
./processing 
If the serial/USB port is streaming data you should see an ECG/Oximeter waveform
